        <p>Yasuo is an agile swordsman who wields the air itself against his enemies. <br><br>As a proud young man, he was falsely accused of murdering his masterâ€”unable <br><br>to prove his innocence, he was forced to slay his own brother in self-defense.
            <br><br>In time, his master's true killer was revealed, and his brother mysteriously returned from death, <br><br>yet Yasuo still could not forgive himself for all he had done. <br><br>Now, he wanders the world with only the wind to guide
            his blade.</p>
